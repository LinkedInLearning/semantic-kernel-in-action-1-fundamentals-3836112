# Semantic Kernel in Action: 1 Fundamentals
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Semantic Kernel in Action: 1 Fundamentals. 
The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main folder for updated instructions and information._

## Instructions
This repository organizes content in folders under `/src/...` for each of the videos in the course that contains a practice or code exercise. 
You can navigate to a specific folder to review the code at that stage of the course.


## Folders
The folders are structured to correspond to the videos in the course that include a practice or code exercise. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. For example, the folder named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter, if that video includes a practice or code exercise.
Some folders will represent the beginning and end states of a practice or code exercise. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` folder contains the code as it is at the beginning of the video. The `e` folder contains the code as it is at the end of the video. The `main` folder holds the final state of the code for the course.

This method/structure is simpler than the other method used in LinkedIn courses which uses branches and does not create branch conflicts which arise issues when changes are not committed.
Again, it is recommended that you fork this repository if you'd like to do changes or perform the exercises as intended.

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
	- .NET 8.0, Visual Studio Code, GIT Client and a Azure OpenAI/OpenAI subscription for local development.
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
3. To fully set your environment, follow chapter 02 video 01, which guides you on the setup.

## Last chapter - practice
You will notice that on Chapter 07 there is only one  `b`  beginning folder. This is intended as the `e` corresponding folder are the beginning state for the next practice, so if something does not work, check those folders for anything that might have been missed.
